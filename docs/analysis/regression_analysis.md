# Multiple regression analysis
Performs multiple regression analysis and fits linear models.

## Prerequisite R packages
 * jsonlite

## Used R command
 * [lm](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.4.0/topics/lm)
 * [coef](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.4.1/topics/coef)

## Caution
  * Number formatting settings on measure properties are ignored. 

## Usage
  1. Place [Advanced Analytics Toolbox] extension on a sheet and select [Multiple linear regression Analysis] > [Multiple regression analysis] for [Analysis Type]
  2. Select dimensions and measures
    * Dimension: A field that uniquely identifies each record (examples: `ID`, `Code`)
    * Measure 1: Response variable
    * Remaining measures: Predictor variables

## Options
 * Confidence level - Tolerance/confidence level.

## Example - The Boston Housing Dataset
The Boston housing dataset contains `medv` (median house value) for 506 neighborhoods around Boston. In this example, we seek to predict `medv` using predictors such as `rm` (average number of rooms per house), `age` (average age of house) and `crim` (per capita crime rate by town).

  1. Download the following sample file.
    * Boston ( [Download file](./data/Boston.xlsx) | [Description on the dataset](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) )  
  2. Load the downloaded file into a new Qlik Sense app.
  3. Place [Advanced Analytics Toolbox] extension on a sheet and select [Multiple linear regression Analysis] > [Multiple regression analysis] for [Analysis Type].
  4. Select `[id]` for a dimension.
  5. Select `Sum([medv])` for the first measure as a response (dependent) variable. These are the values we seek to predict.
  6. We are adding 13 predictor (independent) variables. Press [+] button to add measure button, and select the following fields for these measures:
    * `crim` - per capita crime rate by town
    * `zn` - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
    * `indus` - proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    * `chas` - Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds)
    * `nox` - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    * `rm` - average number of rooms per dwelling
    * `age` - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    * `dis` - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    * `rad` - index of accessibility to radial highways
    * `tax` - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    * `ptratio` - pupil-teacher ratio by town
    * `black` - _1000(Bk - 0.63)^2_ where _Bk_ is the proportion of blacks by town
    * `lstat` - percentage of lower status of the population
  7. The following chart is displayed. Two or three stars on the Coefficients table represent small p-values, which indicates that there is a relationship between a predictor variable and `medv` as the response variable. The R-squared provides a measurement on how well the model is fitting the actual data. In this example, the R-squared we get is 0.7406, which indicates that 74% of the response variable can be explained by the predictor variables.
